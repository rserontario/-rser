      <h3>Mixing oil and gas in 2-cycle engines</h3>
      
      <p class="indent">2-cycle or 2-stroke engines require a mixture of oil and gas. 
        The oil provides proper lubrication to the internal engine parts. 
        Most 2-cycle engines require a mixture of 50:1 or 40:1 ratio of fuel to oil. 
        If your not sure what ratio your engine requires, your user manual will let you know or you can get a hold of me and I can look it up for you.
        I use a 5L gas container, fill it to the 5L mark with premium gas (no ethanol is good) and add 100mL of premium synthetic 2-cycle oil for a 50:1 mix.
      For a 40:1 mix, I use a second 5L container and fill it with premium gas,  mix it with 110mL of premium synthetic 2-cycle oil. Both containers should now be labelled with 50:1 or 40:1. 
      I also add a little StaBol to both containers to keep the gas fresh. </p>
